## InputDialog

The `InputDialog` component is a dialog that allows the user to input some text. It is quite similar to the `Prompt` dialog, but it is more flexible and allows for more customization. See `InputDialogDemo` for an example of how to use it.

Dependencies: `shadcn` components and `lucice-react` package.
